Welcome to my personal website!

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.vt.edu) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu) under supervision of [Walid Saad](https://www.netsciwis.com/), since 2021. I received my B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en), Iran in 2012, my M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), Iran in 2014, and Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), Iran in 2020.
